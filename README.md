## Image-Source-Data-Final-Processing

1. This program is the final processing tool following some defined rules on source data for A.I deep learning.
   After naming, the whole image data in .\date-folder\worker-folder are sorted to .\date-folder\class_name-folder with new instance number
2. Even if it is being used and debugged now, it still has some bugs due to unsufficient debugging time.
3. It doesn't have a function to make "create" folder. But it is necessary for some log files and history of instance by class.
   Please maintains "create" folder and "class_ins_hist.txt" file. Or add its code.
4. This program makes tmp folder with newly named image files. And then they are copied to new folder system.
   Then tmp folder is removed.
   So, your remained hard disk volume should be big enough.
5. If you have any special classes to manage, after defining them at coding, you can get some statistics on them at "create/class_ins_(date).txt" file.
